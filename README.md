## 🧩 What Does It Actually Do?

**Image Type and Region:**
- Determines the type of image (no, it doesn’t mix up MRIs with your vacation photos).

**Key Findings:**
- Lists observations in a systematic manner, like a neat freak with a medical degree.
- Highlights abnormalities because that’s what it’s here for.

**Diagnostic Assessment:**
- Provides a ranked list of potential diagnoses (with all the confidence of a medical pro).
- Suggests differential diagnoses just in case.
- Assesses severity ("Is it bad? Or really bad?").

**Patient-Friendly Explanations:**
- Turns complex medical jargon into language you’ll actually understand.
- Adds visual reference points to ensure you’re not lost.

## ⚠️ A Few Notes to Remember:
